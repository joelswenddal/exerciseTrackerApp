## General info
I designed this exercise tracker to practice implementing a Full-Stack MERN app. REST API and use of Model-View-Controller pattern were key considerations. This project was connected to activity in my Web Development course in my CS program at Oregon State University.

## Technologies

* React
* Javascript, Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB

## Setup
The front and back end are separated into two files (exercise-ui and exercise-rest). For each, navigate to the root directory, `run npm` install and `npm start`.

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

The REST API runs on port 3000.
